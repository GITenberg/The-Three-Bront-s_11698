description: This study of the Brontë sisters, published in 1912, showcases Sinclair's
  sometimes acerbic critical acumen. As the author herself notes, because all the
  best things about the Brontës have been said already, I have had to fall back on
  the humble day-labour of clearing away some of the rubbish that has gathered around
  them.
